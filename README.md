# Physics-Instrument-Tracker
This was my final project in my Database Course (CPSC 440).  This database system tracks the instruments in a particle accelerator, like the ones used for physics experiments at Jefferson Lab or CERN. It provides information about beam-line elements and their properties. The database is structured in such a way as to reduce data redundancy and errors. In the future, this database could provide data services to a web application, for example, to allow users to search and browse elements and update properties.
